      "In order to play the motif 840 times in succession, it would be advisable
      to prepare oneself beforehand, and in the deepest silence, by serious
      immobilities."

      It’s unclear whether Satie actually intended for the performer to attempt to
      play this short piece 840 times, or even if he composed it for public
      performance at all. The piece was largely ignored until an eighteen-hour
      marathon performance by twelve rotating pianists in 1963 at the Pocket
      Theater in Manhattan.

      My interpretation for FM synthesizer starts by using parameters that
      produce a sound similar to an electric piano. Each repetition, a single
      random bit is flipped in the FM chip’s registers to gradually distort the
      timbre. The chip’s internal state is shown on the monitor; bits that have
      been flipped are shown in red. Keyboard commands are provided to manually
      change the sound or reset to the original parameters if the music has
      become inaudible.
