    <h2><img src="images/iidx.gif"> Arcade UFO</h2>
    <p>
      I have been a visitor to <a href="http://arcadeufo.com/">Arcade UFO</a>
      since 2013 and became one of the owners in 2017. Our team is dedicated to
      bringing the authentic Japanese game center experience to Austin! We
      primarily feature rhythm games (BEMANI, etc.) and fighting games
      (everything from Super Turbo to PS5 titles). We also have some shmups from
      CAVE, a wide selection of SEGA NAOMI titles, and a few classics!
    </p>

    <p>
      We recently moved to an amazing new location at
      <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3864130910">9029 Research
        Blvd</a>. Come check us out if you're in the area!

    <h2><img src="images/pencil.gif"> Tech notes</h2>
    <p>
      I do a fair amount of electronics repair and also spend quite a bit of
      time making obscure software/hardware combinations work out. Here are some
      notes I've taken in these situations, so they might help someone else
      trying to do the same thing. <em>(these are all TODO for now, will be
        adding more ideas as I think of other procedures I've done)</em>
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Nanao MS8-29 arcade monitor - no horizontal or vertical sync</li>
      <li>IBM 8513 VGA monitor - no high voltage</li>
      <li>Using a CF card as a hard drive for the ThinkPad 235</li>
      <li>Compiling a modern Linux kernel for 68k Mac</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><img src="images/programming.gif"> Recent projects</h2>
    <p>
      Here are some of the programming projects I've been working on. Most of
      these are focused on retrocomputing, but not for nostalgic reasons -
      programming for old systems is just fun because it's actually possible for
      one person to mostly understand everything that's going on, from the CPU
      up.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is in contrast to how I develop professionally, where I use the
      modern tools and processes necessary to produce a high-quality,
      maintainable product, no matter how many layers of abstraction are
      involved. :-)

      <a href="crane/">Crane SNES graphics editor</a>
    </h3>

    <p>Web-based editor for 4bpp SNES graphics. Supports creation of 8x8 and
    16x16 tiles and placing the tiles in backgrounds. Also supports assignment
    of colors to palettes. Crane is under active development and feature
    requests are welcome - I wrote this for my own game but it might be useful
    to y'all too!</p>

    </h3>
    <p>
      An art project for the IBM PC and Yamaha YM3812 (AdLib). Vexations is a
      piano piece that the composer ostensibly wished to be played 840 times in
      a row. My version flips a random bit in the synthesizer patch each
      iteration to gradually distort the sound.

    <h3><img src="images/gb.gif"> gb6</h3>
    <p>
      This is a Game Boy emulator for System 6. I originally targeted an 8 MHz
      68000 with the intention of running on a Macintosh Plus, but eventually
      realized I'd only have about six 68000 cycles per Game Boy cycle. This
      isn't really enough to interpret the CPU instruction, let alone emulate the
      LCD, sound, and all that other stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than write a 68k to LR35902 JIT (which I seriously considered), I
      decided to stick with my interpreter and increase my minimum target
      machine to the Macintosh IIci, which came out the same year as the Game
      Boy and features the ~amazing~ 25 MHz 68030. It's better, but still
      unplayably slow. I've put this on hold for now, but there are definitely
      more optimizations I could make, especially in the drawing code. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Somebody managed to write a <a href="https://phoinix.sourceforge.io">Game
        Boy emulator for the Palm III</a>, which features a 16 MHz 68k, so I
      think this is definitely possible.

    <h3>IIDX Tier List</h3>
    <p>
      This application allows you to track your scores on level 11 and 12
      notecharts in beatmania IIDX. Screenshots are from the 
      <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/">Mini vMac</a>
      emulator, but this has also been successfully tested on a real Macintosh 
      Plus!
