    <h2>Arcade UFO</h2>
    <p>
      I have been a visitor to <a href="http://arcadeufo.com/">Arcade UFO</a>
      since 2013 and became one of the owners in 2017. Our team is dedicated to
      bringing the authentic Japanese game center experience to Austin! We
      primarily feature rhythm games (BEMANI, etc.) and fighting games
      (everything from Super Turbo to PS5 titles). We also have some shmups from
      CAVE, a wide selection of SEGA NAOMI titles, and a few classics!
    </p>

    <p>
      We recently moved to an amazing new location at
      <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3864130910">9029 Research
        Blvd</a>. Come check us out if you're in the area!
    </p>

    <h2>Tech notes</h2>
    <p>
      I do a fair amount of electronics repair and also spend quite a bit of
      time making obscure software/hardware combinations work out. Here are some
      notes I've taken in these situations, so they might help someone else
      trying to do the same thing. <em>(these are all TODO for now, will be
        adding more ideas as I think of other procedures I've done)</em>
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Nanao MS8-29 arcade monitor - no horizontal or vertical sync</li>
      <li>IBM 8513 VGA monitor - no high voltage</li>
      <li>Using a CF card as a hard drive for the ThinkPad 235</li>
      <li>Compiling a modern Linux kernel for 68k Mac</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recent projects</h2>
    <p>
      Here are some of the programming projects I've been working on. Most of
      these are focused on retrocomputing, but not for nostalgic reasons -
      programming for old systems is just fun because it's actually possible for
      one person to mostly understand everything that's going on, from the CPU
      up.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is in contrast to how I develop professionally, where I use the
      modern tools and processes necessary to produce a high-quality,
      maintainable product, no matter how many layers of abstraction are
      involved. :-)

    <h3>IIDX Tier List</h3>

      This application allows you to track your scores on level 11 and 12
      notecharts in beatmania IIDX. Screenshots are from the 
      <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/">Mini vMac</a>
      emulator, but this has also been successfully tested on a real Macintosh 
      Plus!
