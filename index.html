<p>Hello! My name is Matt. Nice to meet you. I spend most of my time doing Android development at Atlassian. In my free time, you will probably find me working on various reverse engineering-related side projects or playing music games at Arcade UFO. I also enjoy restoring old computers and attempting to use them for some modern tasks.</p>
